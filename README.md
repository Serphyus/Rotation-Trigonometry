  Rotation Trigonometry
</h1>

This project uses a general rotation matrix to calculate the rotation
of a model consisting of [x,y,z] vertices to represent each point in it's shape.
The models consist of a sequence of numpy arrays to represent each vertex and
a sequence of tuples with 2 indexes to represent the edges of the model. The
model of choice is generated at the start and rendered using pygame.
